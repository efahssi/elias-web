Hey there! Thanks for stopping by. I'm [Author], a curious explorer typically found in the fields of construction, manufacturing, architecture, and design. These days, you'll find me thinking about Product Marketing and Go-To-Market Strategy, a space where my love for tech and the built environment has come together in fascinating ways. 

For the specifics of my journey, why not take a peek at my [resume](https://elias.fahssi.ca/resume)?

My academic trip took me from Linguistics through Philosophy and Sociology, finally finding home in English. This winding path might seem eclectic, but it's what built my knack for seeing connections, making sense of the complex, and telling stories that connect.

At the heart of my work, you'll find a commitment to audience-focused communication. Whether it's a technical document, business proposal, or a piece of creative writing, my aim is to write in a way that drives action, provide clarity, and spark the light of excitement.

I'm a pragmatic thinker at the core but I never shy away from bringing creativity and curiosity into my work.

One of my personal highlights? Staying connected with Mount Royal University, the place that transformed me. As an alumnus, I strive to give back through projects and volunteer work, fostering the same vibrant community that shaped me.

I'm endlessly fascinated by the interplay between tech and our lives, especially in how we shape our built environment. Whether it's digitizing medieval manuscripts or spearheading cutting-edge construction tech, I'm all about making meaningful contributions to our evolving digital landscape.

## When I'm Not in Work Mode...

...you might find me cheering for Celtic FC (Glasgow's green and white), getting lost in a book, listening to a full album, or trying out new fountain pen inks. I've also thematically reorganized my pin collection more than once.

In a nutshell, that's me -- Elias. My journey is packed with "right place, right time" moments and I'm grateful for the people who've believed in me along the way. I'm excited for what's to come and ready to embrace new opportunities with open arms. So, whether you're here for professional interests or just to say hi, thank you for stopping by. I appreciate it.
