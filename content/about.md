Hey there! Thanks for stopping by. I'm **Elias**, a curious explorer typically found in the fields of construction, manufacturing, architecture, and design. These days, you'll find me thinking about Product Marketing and Go-To-Market Strategy, a space where my love for tech and the built environment has come together in fascinating ways. 

For the specifics of my journey, why not take a peek at my [resume](https://elias.fahssi.ca/resume)?

My academic life took me from Linguistics through Philosophy and Sociology, finally finding home in English. This winding path might seem eclectic, but it's what built my knack for seeing connections, making sense of the complex, and telling stories that connect.

I'm endlessly fascinated by the interplay between tech and our lives, especially in how we shape our built environment. 

## When I'm Not in Work Mode...

...you might find me awake at 4am to Celtic FC (Glasgow's green and white), getting lost in a book, listening to a full album, or trying out new fountain pen inks. I've also thematically reorganized my enamel pin collection more than once.

In a nutshell, that's me. My journey is packed with "right place, right time" moments and I'm grateful for the people who've believed in me along the way. I'm excited for what's to come and ready to embrace new opportunities with open arms. So, whether you're here for professional interests or just to say hi, thank you for stopping by. I appreciate it.
