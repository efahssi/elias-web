Welcome to my digital garden, a blank page where [pen trials](https://medievalbooks.nl/tag/pen-trials/) -- thoughts, reflections, and insights -- take shape. 

Topics may include, but not limited to, the use of computers in humanities teaching and research, prefabrication and off-site construction, music and fountain pen reviews, marketing, business technology, or hot takes on architecture.
