Welcome to my digital garden, an open book where [pen trials](https://medievalbooks.nl/tag/pen-trials/) -- thoughts, reflections, and insights -- take shape. 

Topics may include, but not limited to, the use of computers in humanities teaching and research, prefabrication and off-site construction, music and fountain pen reviews, marketing, business technology, or hot takes on architecture.

Read more [about](/about) this site, see [what I've built](/portfolio), and [work with me](https://elias.fahssi.ca/resume) on your next big problem.
