Let's start with a term you may not be familiar with: [Digital Humanities](https://guides.lib.utexas.edu/digitalhumanities/introductory-readings). It's a field that applies computational methods to the study of art, literature, history, and other traditionally "human" disciplines. It's about using technology to extract new insights from traditional sources, and opening up new questions and research opportunities. 

One of the best examples of this is the Cotton Nero A.x. project. Using advanced imaging technology, scholars digitized a 14th-century manuscript containing the only known copies of four different poems. This kind of work is only possible due to the advances in imaging and computing power over the past decades.

More modern examples of digital humanities are projects like [Canada Declassified](https://dhn.utoronto.ca/project/canada-declassified/), which maintains Cold War period records from 1945 through 1991, or [music21](http://web.mit.edu/music21/), a toolkit for analyzing musical structure and content written in Python.

For me, John Unsworth's 2012 [article](https://journal.digitalmedievalist.org/article/id/6983/) in Digital Medievalist captures the essence of what made me fall in love with medieval studies in the first place:
> that medievalists are often early adopters of new technologies, and also that medievalists have benefitted, time and again, from their interactions with other fields... medievalists continue to be interested in exploring what new technology can bring to some well-established scholarly practices and genres.

If this sounds initially counterinuititve but exciting, you're in good company. Looking back there's a clear thread on my journey into marketing and product.

Just like medievalists, those studying an old subject, are heavy adopters of new technology, there are parallels to the construction industry and its "productivity gap."

I discovered digital humanities through medieval studies, and marketing through construction.

You see, construction is one of those sectors that has long lagged the productivity leaps seen in other industries. The 2017 [McKinsey report](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/reinventing-construction-through-a-productivity-revolution) is often cited, which Mark Farmer's ["Modernize or Die"](https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Farmer_Review_2016:_Modernise_or_die) reported a year earlier: construction was lagging in the race to efficiency. These are only two such studies, but the refrain remains constant with echoes of the same efficiency-bound challenges seen in early [Sears catalogues](http://www.searsarchives.com/homes/1908-1914.htm).

But here's the exciting part: we're on the cusp of a paradigm shift. Enter Industrialized Construction, Building Information Modelling (BIM), and Virtual Design and Construction (VDC). Like Digital Humanities, these technologies are adding new opportunities to an existing field, unlocking efficiencies, and providing new insights.

> Industrialized construction uses industrialized production methods—such as high-volume off-site construction, prefabrication, and on-site construction automation—to build or retrofit buildings, leading to reduced costs and the potential for increased energy efficiency and decarbonization. -[National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/buildings/industrialized-construction.html)

Industrialized construction brings the assembly-line efficiency of manufacturing to construction. Projects that would have taken months can now be completed in weeks. And because most of the work is done in a controlled factory environment, there's less waste, fewer delays due to weather, and a higher standard of quality control.

BIM and VDC take it a step further by creating detailed 3D models of a building before construction begins. These models allow architects, engineers, and builders to collaborate more efficiently, identify potential issues before they become costly problems, and ensure the project stays on schedule and within budget.

Just as Digital Humanities revolutionized the study of traditional liberal arts disciplines, similar adoptions of technology are poised to transform construction. And across both fields, technology-enabled approaches are no longer seen as separate methods, but are increasingly adopted into mainstream best practices. By combining the old with the new, we stand at the brink of a new era of productivity and innovation.
