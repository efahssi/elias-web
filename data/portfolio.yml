        description: 'Cotton Nero A.x. is a 14th century manuscript in the British Library. It is the only existing copy of 4 important Middle English poems: *Sir Gawain and the Green Knight*, *Pearl*, *Patience*, and *Cleanness*. The Project published high-quality digital photographs of the entire manuscript; transcribed the entire manuscript at the highest possible level of accuracy and detail; and finally produced editions of each of the individual poems. We used XML to describe manuscript features, and provided a full transcription together with a descriptions of the scribal hand.'
